<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDP, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Using resources in Azure, create environment consisting of a Windows 10 Virtual Machinee (VM), a Linux Ubuntu VM, and a Virtual Network and Subnet
- Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect to Windows 10 VM
- Install Wireshark on Windows 10 VM
- Set Wireshark to filter for ICMP packets and attempt to ping a public website, observing ping requests and replies
- Initiate perpetual ping to Ubuntu VM's private IP address
- Edit Azure Network Security Group for Ubuntu VM and disable incoming (inbound) ICMP traffic, observing Wireshark ICMP activity
- Re-enable ICMP traffic for Ubuntu VM and observe Wireshark ICMP activity, then terminate perpetual ping
- Set Wireshark to filter for SSH traffic and establish SSH connection to Ubuntu VM, observing Wireshark SSH traffic then exit connection
- Set Wireshark to filter for DHCP traffic and use command line to issue Windows 10 VM new IP address (ipconfig /renew), then observe Wireshark DHCP traffic
- Set Wireshark to filter for DNS traffic, then use nslookup to locate IP addresses for public websites, observing Wireeshark DNS traffic
- Set Wireshark to filter for RDP traffic and observe continuous traffic in Wireshark from live RDP connection to Windows 10 VM
- Close RDP connection and clean up Azure resources
